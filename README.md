## Input
Input is the way the computer gets information from the user

Note: Python initially treats input as a `string` type


Ex.
5 --> "5"

Today is Monday --> "Today is Monday"

### Formula:
`variableName = input("prompt")`

Prompt - A question or statement that the computer asks the user

Python stores the  __input__ in the __variableName__


## Operators
###  Arithmetic operators
use to perform mathematical operations 

1. addition `+`
2. subtraction `-`
3. multiplication `*`
4. division `/` (exact answer), `//` (quotient division)
5. modulo `%` (remainder)
6. exponent `**`

Ex.
```python #code block
print(5/2) #2.5
print(5//2) #2
print(5%2) #1
print(4**2) #16
```

### Assignment operators
1. `=` simple assignment
2. `+=` Addition assignment
3. `-=` Subtraction assignment
4. `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `**=`, `%=`

Ex.
```python
a = 2
a += 3 #5, a = a + 3 
a = 1 # 1
a = 3 # 3
```
### Comparison operators
1. `==` equal to
2. `>=` greater than or equal to
3. `>` greater than
4. `<=` less than or equal to
5. `<` less than
6. `!=` not equal to

### Boolean operators
1. `and` (Precedence)
2. `or`
3. `not`
